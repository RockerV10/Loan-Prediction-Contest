This is machine learning examination. Dataset and problem statement is used from [Analytics Vidhya - Loan Prediction contest](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/#About).

Full analysis, along with a description, was prepared and executed in **R Markdown**.
This workbook was also used as semester evaluation for the subject ***Non-classical statistical methods***.

[GitHub repository](https://github.com/RockerV10/Loan-prediction-contest) for this analysis.

## **Work problem**
  
This database contains data from **Dream Housing Finance** company regarding mortgages. DHF wants to automatize the evaluation of new customers. 


Any suggestions, tips and reviews are appreciated as it is my first ML analysis.
